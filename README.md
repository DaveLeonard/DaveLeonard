# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### What I am working on
I'm currently the Deputy Head of IT | Cybersecurity, DevOps, GIS, Infrastructure & Operations @[Holdigaz](https://www.holdigaz.ch).
Most of my work is hosted on a private Gitlab server and doesn't show here.

I'm an occasional game developer. Currently, I'm creating Airborne! Redux for Playdate. You can follow the devlog [here] ðŸŒ±(https://infosec.exchange/@david_senate/112370952865091184#.)
